# Terminal_web_search
Use the web without using a web browser!
Optimum use: Run the program in terminal by typing 'python terminal_web_search.py' in the right directory. Enter desired search,
and number of results required, there may be a bit of lag (because of the API's constraints), simply enter the number of the 
desired search result and it will open up that page in the default web browser!
